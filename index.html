            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>

    <!--change the elements to sections but looking at the layout of the site, this might not be the appropriate way of doing proper symantec html. It looks the same sure, but I will try writing in aside elements since that what it truly is-->

            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.

                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.

        <!--Yeah I'm not sure which is more approprate to use. The website still functions perfectly if using either the section element or the aside element. It just seems to be context sensitive but I think using the aside is the more approprate symantec element to use.-->

<!--I also thought about using the Prettier extension in VSS to fix some of the indents and spacing in the code, but I decided not to. I find it easier to read then what prettier throws out.-->
