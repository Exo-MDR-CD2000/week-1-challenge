# <Week 1 Challenge>

## Description

This weekly challenge tested my ability in reading and understading symantec HTML elements. The non symantec elements were labeled as divs and often used id's for attributes. I had to slowly change the code to bring it up to more modern standards. This type of coding is called refractoring which means to modify the structure, organization, or desgin of an existing code without changing its external behavior or functionality. The website worked fine as it was, but it lacked proper accessibility when it used divs and id's. Symantec elements were used such as sections, asides, and navs. A few lines in the CSS code were changed but only on the selectors; the containers were not changed.
